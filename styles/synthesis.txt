Usage:
1. In the index.js of the project, import a style object from nd_frontend.
2. In the index.html of the project, add the related custom_style.css file.

Benefits:
- It takes 5 lines of code to change to swap the style of a project to a new css-framework.
- Force devs to isolate styling functionality from the logic.
- When coding style, devs do not have to wonder about genericity: they write the style for a specific css framework.
- When coding logic, devs do not have to wonder about the style: they use the style object provided by the framework -> ticket responsibility made clearer.
- Styles related to different frameworks are isolated in different files, making it easier to maintain and update.
- Starting a new style can be quite easy as we can copy/paste the style file of another framework.
